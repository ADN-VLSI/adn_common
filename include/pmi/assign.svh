/*

### Purpose
This file provides a set of SystemVerilog macros designed to simplify the assignment and connection of APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) interface signals between a master and a slave. It abstracts the repetitive task of mapping individual bus signals, reducing boilerplate code and minimizing the risk of connection errors.

### Use Case
This file is primarily used in testbenches or top-level integration modules where an APB Master interface needs to be connected to an APB Slave interface. By using these macros, developers can avoid manually writing out every signal assignment (psel, penable, paddr, etc.), which is prone to copy-paste errors. It supports different assignment types (combinational, blocking, and non-blocking) to accommodate various simulation and synthesis requirements.
